# MyBoxCricket
Develop a simple Android application for box cricket called 'MOTM Calculator.' The app's core purpose is to track player performance in real-time and calculate the 'Man of the Match' based on a point-based scoring system. The user should be able to add players on the fly. The scoring interface must be simple and fast, with dedicated buttons to record runs, wickets, catches, and run outs for each player. The app should not include extras like wides or no-balls. Finally, it should display a leaderboard to show the 'Man of the Match' winner after the data has been entered. The main goal is a streamlined, user-friendly experience for live match scoring.
